Farmers' Market Expansion\n<p>You have been hired by a farming organisation that helps local farmers sell their products. They want to know whether they should open up a new farmers' market to sell dairy products from nearby farmers. They have supplied you with daily shopping data from a panel of local households from 2019 to 2020. </p>\n<p>The organization will make their decision based on whether dairy products are popular in the area, and whether sales are trending in a positive direction. To answer these questions, they want three pieces of data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What was the total number of purchases of dairy products for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>total_sales</code>)?</li>\n<li>What was the total share of dairy products (out of all products purchased) for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>market_share</code>)?</li>\n<li>For each month of 2020, what was the percentage increase or decrease in total monthly dairy purchases compared to the same month in 2019 (i.e., the <code>year_change</code>)?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The organization handles not only dairy farmers, but also those with chicken farms. As a result, they are only interested in these three categories (which they treat as dairy): ‘whole milk’, 'yogurt' and 'domestic eggs'.</p>\n<p>The data you need is available in the tables shown in the database schema below.</p>\n<h5 id=\"databaseschema\">Database Schema</h5>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5960/datasets/463543c8c38957ca5b95d93b02f2cb1bec53334f/diagram.PNG\" alt=\"Database Schema\" width=\"400px\"></p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%sql\npostgresql:///groceries\n    \nWITH ms AS (\nSELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM fulldate) AS month, COUNT(*) AS total_sales\nFROM purchases_2020 AS p \nGROUP BY month),\n\ntotal AS (\nSELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM p.fulldate) AS month, COUNT(*) AS total_sales_diary_2020\nFROM purchases_2020 AS p\nLEFT JOIN categories AS c\nON p.purchaseid = c.purchase_id\nWHERE category IN ('whole milk','yogurt', 'domestic eggs')\nGROUP BY month),\n\nchan AS (\nSELECT p.month, COUNT(*) AS total_sales_diary_2019\nFROM purchases_2019 AS p\nLEFT JOIN categories AS c\nON p.purchase_id = c.purchase_id\nWHERE category IN ('whole milk','yogurt', 'domestic eggs')\nGROUP BY month\n)\n\n\nSELECT t.month, total_sales_diary_2020 AS total_sales,\nROUND(100*total_sales_diary_2020/total_sales::decimal,2) AS market_share,\nROUND(100*(total_sales_diary_2020 - chan.total_sales_diary_2019)/chan.total_sales_diary_2019::decimal,2) AS year_change\nFROM total AS t\nLEFT JOIN ms\nON t.month = ms.month\nLEFT JOIN chan\nON t.month = chan.month\nORDER BY t.month;\n\n","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"12 rows affected.\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":3,"data":{"text/plain":"[(1.0, 228, Decimal('12.47'), Decimal('48.05')),\n (2.0, 165, Decimal('11.11'), Decimal('5.10')),\n (3.0, 216, Decimal('12.05'), Decimal('27.81')),\n (4.0, 218, Decimal('13.09'), Decimal('26.01')),\n (5.0, 195, Decimal('11.40'), Decimal('17.47')),\n (6.0, 196, Decimal('10.94'), Decimal('20.99')),\n (7.0, 195, Decimal('11.85'), Decimal('-0.51')),\n (8.0, 231, Decimal('11.77'), Decimal('32.00')),\n (9.0, 180, Decimal('11.16'), Decimal('4.65')),\n (10.0, 193, Decimal('11.61'), Decimal('17.68')),\n (11.0, 223, Decimal('12.55'), Decimal('36.81')),\n (12.0, 162, Decimal('10.42'), Decimal('8.72'))]","text/html":"<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>month</th>\n            <th>total_sales</th>\n            <th>market_share</th>\n            <th>year_change</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>1.0</td>\n            <td>228</td>\n            <td>12.47</td>\n            <td>48.05</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>2.0</td>\n            <td>165</td>\n            <td>11.11</td>\n            <td>5.10</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>3.0</td>\n            <td>216</td>\n            <td>12.05</td>\n            <td>27.81</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>4.0</td>\n            <td>218</td>\n            <td>13.09</td>\n            <td>26.01</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>5.0</td>\n            <td>195</td>\n            <td>11.40</td>\n            <td>17.47</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>6.0</td>\n            <td>196</td>\n            <td>10.94</td>\n            <td>20.99</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>7.0</td>\n            <td>195</td>\n            <td>11.85</td>\n            <td>-0.51</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>8.0</td>\n            <td>231</td>\n            <td>11.77</td>\n            <td>32.00</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>9.0</td>\n            <td>180</td>\n            <td>11.16</td>\n            <td>4.65</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>10.0</td>\n            <td>193</td>\n            <td>11.61</td>\n            <td>17.68</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>11.0</td>\n            <td>223</td>\n            <td>12.55</td>\n            <td>36.81</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>12.0</td>\n            <td>162</td>\n            <td>10.42</td>\n            <td>8.72</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>"},"metadata":{}}]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.7","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
